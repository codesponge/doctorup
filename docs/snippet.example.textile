h4. What a great Header I am.

This is a paragraph of the stuff.  It is a great paragraph.
Of all the paragraphs that ever where, this is probably,
one of the all time top paragraphs.  It has things that
are *bold*!  Wow, it just keeps getting better.  We find
that _some times_ words are _italic_.  Something is -deleted-.

<code lang='ruby'>
class Dog < Animal
	def speak
		"Woof"
	end
end
