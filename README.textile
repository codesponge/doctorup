h2. Install

I have not yet published DoctorUp as a gem.  DoctorUp uses ultraviolet for syntax highlighting, there are however separate versions for ruby 1.8.x and 1.9.x (ultraviolet and spox-ultraviolet respectively).  I have not come up 
with a consistent solution to have the proper ultraviolet gem get installed as a dependency, if you have any hints on this please let me know.  Furthermore there are some minor difficulties installing the dependencies for ultraviolet.

See this post about installing ultraviolet. [[LINK]]

I will publish as a gem within a few days, in the meantime you can build and install the gem
from source.

h3. Build and install gem from source.

# install ultraviolet or spox-ultraviolet gem "read more"[[LINK]]
# get the source from github
	@git clone git://github.com/codesponge/doctorup.git@


DoctorUp parses text for <pre><code><code>s</code></code></pre> tags.

and adds syntax highlighting!

Documentation is in progress.
